        <h1>Is it possible to become a twicth streamer and a devloper at the same time?</h1>
          <div className='Section2 text'>
         <p>This is a difficult question to answer, and the reason may seem off-topic, but trust me on this. Both careers pose some challenges when it comes to time investment. Time isn't exactly friendly to anyone, especially to me. I would love to spend the entire day coding and nothing else. Unfortunately, I have trouble staying awake during the daytime; afternoons are particularly challenging for me. I can clearly see that development requires a significant amount of time, energy (mental energy), and continuous effort to ensure that the designs are on point.
         Okay, enough of me bringing up the sad and lonely story. Let's get back to answering the question. The short answer is yes, but there are also several downsides to it (at least from my perspective; I'll explain later). Let me start with the first one. Being a developer/streamer is great if your content mainly focuses on coding, tech, and the industry itself. However, in my case, that's not the focus. Personally, I have a small stream that revolves around nothing but hardcore gameplay, dealing with hackers and highly skilled players. As a young unemployed developer trying to gain industry experience in a tech company, I find myself constantly focusing on building my portfolio and, surprisingly enough, working on projects using different languages that I specialize in (I really want to build an app that utilizes MongoDB and Node.js). Juggling between streaming, development, and job hunting is simply frustrating, even for me.</p>
         <p>Being a streamer and a developer simultaneously is a demanding task. The streaming aspect is quite challenging because I always have to fix my audio, create engaging content, and ensure video quality. However, throughout the years of doing this, I have come to realize that becoming a developer/streamer is indeed possible. I know you have many questions, especially the classic "get a job" question. But the real question you want to ask is which one requires more time: coding or streaming? Well, I am a patient person, and I have decided to allocate more of my time to building my skills, preparing for job interviews, and carefully calculating the time and energy required to secure an internship.

You see, it's not just about striving to become a well-known streamer. At the end of the day, it's about trying to add some unique flavor to your life (and please, don't think of anything inappropriate). With that said, do I recommend this to anyone? No, I don't really recommend it to someone who lacks patience. Becoming a developer alone requires a significant investment of time and effort.</p>

            <h1>What I learnt from taking the path of a streamer:</h1>
            <div className="section3 text">
                <p>I could say that I have been more focused on building my channel, but without resources, I have no talent. Just kidding, I have more confidence in myself than anyone else (even though I'm your run-of-the-mill introvert). Now, with only 14 followers on Twitch, I am seriously thinking of taking the path of a developer/streamer more seriously. The challenging part is keeping up with the demanding schedule of both coding and streaming. I need to improve in this area. I have finished building some projects, but there are also React projects that I have not completed. It feels like every day I'm busy working on improving myself rather than improving my financial situation (even though I do need the cash to buy things... like a lot of things).</p>
                <p>Now, I have learned that it's not really about getting the most subscribers and followers. I know this may sound a bit counterintuitive because you might ask, "What is the purpose of streaming then?" Well, sorry for those whose main goal is to get followers and subscribers for monetary gain. The point of streaming is to just have fun and enjoy yourself. Honestly, I don't understand why people fail to see this. But, there's always that person in the Discord/comments who would say things like:</p>
                <uL>
                    <li>"I don't understand why a person who only has 14 followers on Instagram and Twitch would give advice about streaming. You are a pathetic individual."</li>
                    <li>"Why is someone like this giving advice about streaming and being a developer? You're unemployed, you weeb. Go find a girlfriend and a job."</li>
                </uL>
                <p>As the bad comments keep on rolling in... I think you get the message. I don't really care for the slightest bit of aggression that these people say about me. The first thing I will say is that instead of saying it to my face, you hide behind your flat screen and don't have the confidence to say it to me directly. Plus, I don't have any enemies (except cats). When reading this, you might have noticed that I mentioned the second lesson: ignore the bad comments and just block them from your channel. This shows that you only allow good vibes in your stream.</p>
                <p>The third lesson I learned is to avoid comparing myself. Let me explain. I was trapped in comparing my channel to other channels, especially the most famous ones out there. As a mobile gamer (soon to be a console and PC gamer) and as a South African, it's difficult to gain that type of attention and engagement. So, does that bother me? Not really, because I see that I'm making progress. My videos, which used to have at least 5 views, now have at least 15-20 views. To me, that is a huge success. One of the best sessions I had was when Apex Mobile came out. I had at least 23 to 27 views on each video. Now that Call of Duty Warzone is coming out, I am planning to stream it and see where the channel goes from here.</p>
                <p>Overall, the main lesson to take note of is that streaming is meant to be fun and engaging. Trust me when I say this, show your viewers what type of content you have in store for them, and if you have just one follower, be thankful that you are making progress. The fourth and final lesson is patience. I won't go into detail about this and will just say it out loud:</p>
                    <h1 className="ho">Be patient, human.
Success doesn't happen overnight.</h1>

            <h1>What I have learnt as unemployed developer:</h1>
            <div className='section4 text'>
                <p>Well, it's truly embarrassing to admit, but I've realized that embarking on this journey is a long and multi-directional road. Finding the right path can be quite challenging. Personally, I had to make numerous decisions, and for some reason, I chose to be a self-taught developer. During my time at Boston City Campus in South Africa (currently on a gap year – if you're interested in knowing why I took a gap year and how it has improved my tech interview skills, enhanced my streaming channel, and allowed me to focus on personal growth, you can check out this link), I learned some things like Java. However, at that time, I didn't have a laptop to code projects and improve my skills. The most challenging aspect for me in my first year was not being able to code, practice my skills, and enhance my chances of securing a job.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, I stumbled upon a website that taught me JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the website focused on building projects to help users understand coding better. To pass the course, I had to complete several projects that required me to finish the JavaScript algorithms course. This taught me that I don't need the most expensive laptop in the world to learn how to code.</p>
                <p>This experience has given me a newfound confidence in myself. Now, I strive to make progress every single day, except on streaming days. My focus is on developing exciting coding projects and figuring out how to make my CV stand out in various job applications. It has been challenging not having any income and constantly feeling pressured by my parents, especially my dad, to apply for different jobs.</p>

                <p>It may sound strange, but the lesson I've learned is never to pursue something you don't enjoy. Even though coding can be challenging, I am determined to build myself as a developer. Moreover, I've learned another valuable lesson called "Moving on." Let me explain. I couldn't change my past, which still defines me to some extent. I faced rejections from various companies and internships, leading to insomnia that I experience on a daily basis. However, one fateful day, I managed to acquire a laptop, and my creative side (also known as my lazy side) motivated me to begin understanding myself as a person. That's when I realized that if one company doesn't offer me a position, I should move on to the next. It's similar to asking for a girl's number and her kindly declining (which never happens). You just move on. In this career path, projects are not the only valuable aspect. </p>
                <p> Why? Well, a TikToker who landed a $200K job at a major tech company showed me that becoming a developer is not only possible but also quite challenging. At some point, I questioned whether being a developer would be worth it.

The sad truth is that coding wasn't my initial choice, and streaming was something I truly pursued. I wanted to attend a top university and become a robotics engineer. Yes, it may sound far-fetched, even for me to say that I wanted to be a villain (PS: I had a wild imagination in grade 12). Honestly, I wasn't trying to show off to anyone; it was just my aspiration. The reality is that our first choices in life are rarely the right ones. This was a crucial lesson I learned as a young man.</p>
<p>After reflecting on this, I realized an important rule that became evident to me. Every person I encountered on YouTube, Instagram (a side note: if you want to make your Instagram experience friendlier and less toxic, follow content that uplifts you – it worked for me, but ultimately, the decision is yours), and TikTok never gave up</p>
<p>Every time I came across the content created by other users, I was both impressed and slightly frustrated. However, I couldn't help but smile because I enjoy challenging myself and engaging in friendly competition. I wanted to keep pushing forward, constantly seeking new challenges and wondering when I would finally find stability in solving a problem. It was during this time that I stumbled upon another valuable life lesson: to pursue something that brings me pleasure. While I can't go into much detail, I am grateful for discovering this career path.</p>
<p>I understand that not everyone may fully comprehend what I'm talking about, but recently I have set a primary goal for myself – to face every challenge until nothing is left of me. I want to demonstrate to myself and others that achieving something significant requires a well-thought-out plan.</p>
<p>This brings me to the question of taking a gap year in college. Now that I have completed the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript algorithm course, I encourage you to also undertake this course. You will learn a great deal, especially through challenging coding tasks. Additionally, I have completed some cool coding projects in the past that you might find interesting.</p>
