            <h1>Is taking a gap year a wise decision, and how can it benefit my coding skills?</h1>
            <div className='section3 text'>
                <p>I have been on a very rough road. My bursary only lasted for my first year in college, and I didn't take advantage of the hiring processes in 2020-2021, which resulted in me failing to secure a decent internship. All of this happened in my first year. I realized that many times I was rushing to get a job because of my father and other so-called people (whom I have never seen) who always captured my father's attention by talking about job prospects. I was disappointed in myself for not having secured a job. To make matters worse, I didn't even have a decent lifestyle. I was entering a state of depression that nobody has been able to understand.</p>
                <p>Things changed after I applied for a decent job at a school. Even getting that job was difficult for me. The most challenging aspect for me was obtaining a decent testimonial. I also struggled to improve my programming skills, not realizing that I needed money to host my websites and purchase equipment for streaming (such as a microphone and a gaming laptop, which were out of reach for me). It wasn't easy for me to obtain all these things. The most surprising thing I ever did was getting a job. </p>

            <h1></h1>
            <div className=' text'>
                <p>The job was just as a teacher assistant, not really what one would call a job, but the pay lasted me throughout the month. This is the world I live in, where job hunting is a drag, but it does have its own benefits.

This year, I have been able to take advantage of many opportunities that have helped me get back on track. Especially when it comes to building numerous apps, I have developed a strong urge to stop watching coding tutorials and instead use Chat GBT to assist me in coding projects. Honestly, building projects in React and Sass has been an exciting experience for me. It was truly enjoyable when I built my portfolio and blog using React.js and Sass. Now, you might wonder about my backend skill set. Well, I want to work closely with Node.js, Docker, and last but not least, MongoDB as a database. </p>
<p>My main goal is to include these programming skills in my portfolio. I aim to build projects that go hand in hand with a real-time e-commerce shopping website featuring different products, as well as another website for my streaming (which is one of my biggest projects of all time).

I highly doubt that this will be enough for recruiters to give me a chance in the interviewing process. What I can say is that I need to apply for a wide range of opportunities. By "dodgy concepts," I mean whether the job can be seen as legitimate or if it's just false hope where nothing in the world really works. I want to emphasize that I have been consistently improving in my coding endeavors. Yes, I am aware that copying code is wrong and can be considered another version of coding hell.</p>
<p>However, you can't blame me for not seeking help from AI to assist me in building a well-oiled machine where the application works with different versions of code. At the end of the day, it's a project I worked on by myself (though I won't lie, building a blog by myself is quite challenging). What hurts the most is that after completing the app, you tend to forget everything you wrote (I call this burnout), which can make you feel like crap and trigger imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>It has been one year and counting since I landed a developer job, which has been nothing but a disappointment for me. What I dislike the most is not being able to find a well-rounded decent job. However, life has other plans for me, and I am somewhat prepared for it. In short, coding and playing games have been the most enjoyable parts of my life. So, do I want to go back to school and obtain my diploma?

The answer is both yes and no. Personally, I can't find a decent job that would pay for my studies. The amount of money required for me to earn at least 288K per year, which is divided into 12 months, would be 24K per month. With that amount, I can cover my studies and maintain my gaming lifestyle. The downside is that it would be a developer job. On the other hand, the job I would be earning around 100K per year for helping teachers with their paperwork would be approximately 8,333.33 per month. What's scary is the possibility of being trapped in that phase for an extended period of time.</p>

            <h1>Now, what is the phase loop trap? </h1>
            <div className=' section4 text'>
                <p>The loop phase is the biggest scam on this earth. This phase has existed in every era. Let's define the loop phase. It's a situation where you try to build a certain character or skill set, but then you find yourself stuck in the same old character. Sounds confusing, right? Well, let me give you a scenario:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You work on building a solid foundation where you plan to finish school and succeed. However, life throws you a curveball, and you need money for school the following year. So, you decide to get a part-time job to earn some money. You find a decent job that pays around 4,000 to 8,000 rand as a stipend or a job that pays at least 9,000 rand per month. Your intention is to work at that company for 6 to 8 months.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What bothers me is that you get trapped in the phase loop (now you understand what the phase loop really does to unemployed people). It's not a pleasant experience for anyone who is passionate about pursuing something meaningful. In South Africa, the system favors the loop trap, where many people are stuck in low-paying jobs that don't even cover their monthly expenses. It's disheartening to see how the loop system destroys the youth's creativity, passion, and character. I have witnessed a lot of individuals experiencing depression (poverty being a catalyst for this unspoken factor). What hurts me even more is how parents fail to see that their children are not heading in the right direction, which should prompt them to assist their children in building a career in something they are passionate about (unless their passion is not reasonable or lacks a solid track record).</p>
                <h1 className='section3 ho'>It's painful when you hear your own parents say things like:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Hello, son. I want you to apply for a job at this certain company."</li>
                    <li>"Hey, there is this job that this lady applied for, and she got it. I want you to apply at this company as quickly as possible. Try looking for some opportunities."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Listen to me carefully for a moment. I understand they are your parents, and they are just looking out for you. But the reality is that randomly applying to jobs without knowing the details, what they offer, and what they can offer you, while disregarding your own preferences, is not productive. Another thing I've noticed is that the loop trap makes parents angry and shocked when their child gets rejected by a job. Let me tell you, facing job rejection is not a setback but an opportunity to learn and grow. Trust me when I say that trying</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <div className=' section4 text'>
                <p>Now the year is coming to an end for my current job. This is because I have learned, especially, about what it means to be a developer/streamer and a person. I want to learn all the things that come with understanding what it means to be a developer/streamer. I've grown very tired of my job, and I want more than just the one I'm working at. I am about to go back to school, or am I going back to searching for a developer's job? This is a state of emergency. I don't want to just wake up next morning and do nothing; I want to regain control of my life. It is sad that I won't be able to go abroad, but that's fine with me</p>
                <p>Not being able to travel overseas has to be one of the toughest experiences. However, working at Alex High School has proven to be the most challenging endeavor known to man. What makes it difficult is that I can't be the person who leads. Currently, I have been working as a freelance developer (unfortunately, with no clients) and am actively seeking opportunities to gain work experience at specific tech firms. Now, I find myself discussing issues unrelated to the initial questions. So, let me focus on the core of this matter.

The reality is that we have no choice but to break free from this repetitive cycle. The phase loop is precisely what I am experiencing, but I intend to be the first to escape it. How? I don't know yet, but I'm determined to find the way. I am hopeful that I will overcome my fears and regrets. As an introvert who values solitude, moments of quiet are rare but precious. It's rare to be content, but we must move forward and embrace our roles as developers, streamers, and individuals. So, remember to stay true to yourself.</p>
